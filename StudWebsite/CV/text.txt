General
--------------------------------
// more into statically typed and strict languages (compile time
safety, TDD nice but...)
// much into OOP, with some functional and aspect influences

Googler's Languages
--------------------------------
C/C++
 ... done lots of things in C and C++ (and C# and Objective-C), dont
like it because its too close too hardware (need higher abstraction
layer) ...
Python
 ... easy, using it from time to time, believe in TDD but not feeling
comfortable with dynamic typed languages ...

"Communication protocols", exercises written in python ...
