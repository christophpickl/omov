                            II. JOBS & EDUCATION

2009-.... Flex Developer, Build and Release Engineer @ Bwin
         I am currently employed by bwin Interactive Entertainment AG where I
         started as a front-end developer (ActionScript, Flex Framework) for
         the livebetting product [BwLi] which is one of the biggest Flex
         application in the world, written by +20 people.
         Meanwhile my main responsibility is the build and release management
         of this product, providing services to ~15 people and mainly dealing
         with Subversion, Maven, Hudson and other related SCM technologies.
2005-.... Vienna University of Technology (Software- & Information Engineering)
         Besides my current employment I try to study as much as possible,
         whereas I prefer to go my own way than to follow a (questionable)
         plan. See attached transcript [Tran10] for a list of passed courses,
         and the other two noteworthy attachments [CwTh06] and [CwSs05].
2008-2009 Java Developer @ Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs
         Instead of joining the army I decided to work as a civil servant for
         the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs where I implemented parts
         of the Schengen Information System II. This enormous project mainly
         used JEE technology (JMS) and involved several countries. See attached
         testimonial [TeBm09].
2007-2009 Java Developer, Tutor @ s IT solutions AT (Erste Group Bank)
         Before the employment at bwin I worked for the IT service provider
         of the Erste Group Bank where my main responsibility was the
         customization of EMC's Documentum, which was done via the Java API.
         A custom front-end was implemented with (meanwhile open sourced)
         in-house developed (open)XMA framework. I was also part of the
         internal organization called Software Engineering Academy which
         included OOP/Java trainings, conferences, programming challenges,
         presentations, et cetera. See attached testimonial [TeSi09].
2007-2009 Private Tutor @ Lern im Team
         This was somehow a minor occupation. I taught pupils at secondary
         schools for the subjects computer science and financial mathematics.
2007-2008 Tutor @ Vienna University of Technology
         Because of the excellent graduation in the lectures Object Oriented
         Programming (Java) and Development of Web Applications (Ajax, JSF,
         WebML) he worked as a tutor at the Vienna University of Technology.
2006-2007 Java Developer @ Procon Data
         This job was about implementing an enormous JSF-based web application
         for and in co-operation with the Federal Environmental Agency. About
         30 people worked on the representation and extraction of scientific
         information, whereas my main responsibility was the JSF part and
         especially the spatial visualisation by a geo-component.
2004-2008 Web Developer as a Freelancer
         Already in the early age of 18 years I launched my own company, as I
         started writing web applications for local shops. I did all the work
         on my own (requirements, design, implementation, test) and focused on
         web based content management systems with PHP, MySQL and Flash. See
         chapter III. References & Open Source for some examples.
2001-2003 Junior IT consultant @ Oesterreichisches Juedisches Museum
         I gained my first working experience as a museum employee with 16
         years. It originally started as a holiday job but turned to a
         long-term employment pretty soon. Tasks involved: Euro change-over
         (Access), business statistics (Access, Excel), website (HTML, Flash),
         extending/wiring of the local network and many other minor things.
2000-2005 Federal Commercial Academy Eisenstadt (ICT pilot project)

                           IV. COMPUTER LANGUAGES
General
--------------------------------
// more into statically typed and strict languages (compile time
safety, TDD nice but...)
// much into OOP, with some functional and aspect influences

Googler's Languages
--------------------------------
C/C++
... done lots of things in C and C++ (and C# and Objective-C), dont
like it because its too close too hardware (need higher abstraction
layer) ...
Python
... easy, using it from time to time, believe in TDD but not feeling
comfortable with dynamic typed languages ...
... recently in moldowa, university sommer course about
"Communication protocols", exercises written in python ...
Java
... MY language, using it since 2003 ...

List of Languages
