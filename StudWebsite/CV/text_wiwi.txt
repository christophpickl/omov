                            II. JOBS & EDUCATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flex Developer @ Bwin (2009-....)
    I am currently employed !!!! at!!!! (by) Bwin Interactive Entertainment AG [CoPu09] where I started as a front-end developer (Adobe Flex) for the livebetting application [MiBw09] (an article [MiBw10] was released recently in Computerwelt) which is said to be one of the biggest Flex application !!! (applications?) !!! in the world, written by +20 people. Meanwhile my main responsibility is the build and release management [SlMa09] of this product, providing services to ~15 people and mainly dealing with Maven, Hudson and Subversion. Furthermore I am the initiator and leader of a unit test taskforce whose aim is to educate the team in testing and get sure they have the proper environment to write/run tests smoothly.

Student @ Vienna University of Technology (2005-....)
    Besides my current employment I try to do as much as possible for my studies (Software- & Information Engineering), whereas I prefer to go my own way than to follow a (questionable) plan provided by others. See the attached transcript [AtTr10] for a list of my passed courses. What could be of interest is my scientific paper about SSH [MiSs05] as well as a script [MiTh06] I have written for the lecture "Theory of Computer Science 2". As part of one of my courseworks I want to mention "HD Scan", a disk usage utility for the course "Software Engineering and Project Management" written in Java, whereas my main responsibility was the implementation of the graphical user interface (Swing) and the documentation [PrHd07] which was a highly sophisticating project at its own using LaTeX. A similar approach was used by me before to create the documentation for the course "Project Management" [PrPm06] where we had to think of a !!! (an) !!! imaginary health care system.

Java Developer @ Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs (2008-2009)
    Instead of joining the army I decided to work as a civil servant for the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs where I implemented parts of the Schengen Information System II. This immense project principally used JEE technology (JMS) and involved several European countries.

Java Developer @ s IT solutions AT (2007-2009)
    Before the employment at Bwin I worked for the IT service provider of the Erste Group Bank [CoDi07] where my main responsibility was the customization and maintenance of EMC's Documentum which was done via a Java API. Suprisingly I was given big responsibilities as I refactored the whole type hierarchy of the core classes, and also reworked some other major parts of the system. A custom front-end was implemented with (the meanwhile open sourced) in-house developed openXMA framework [MiOp07]. I was also part of the internal organization called "Software Engineering Academy" which included OOP/Java trainings, conferences, programming challenges, presentations [SlFu08], et cetera.

Private Tutor @ Lern im Team (2007-2009)
    As I was, and still I am, much into educating other people and trying to share as much of my knowledge as possible, I taught pupils of secondary schools for the Lern im Team agency [MiLe07] in the subjects computer science and financial mathematics.

Tutor @ Vienna University of Technology (2007-2008)
    Because of the excellent graduation in the lectures "Object Oriented Programming" (Java) and "Development of Web Applications" (Ajax, JSF, WebML) I worked two times as a tutor at the Vienna University of Technology, where I had to assist other students as well as graduate their exercises.

Java Developer @ Procon Data (2006-2007)
    My job at Procon Data [CoSo06] was about implementing an JSF-based web application for, and in co-operation with, the Federal Environmental Agency of Austria. About 30 people worked on the extraction and representation of scientific information, whereas my main responsibility was the JSF part and especially the spatial visualisation by a geo-component.

Web Developer as a Freelancer (2004-....)
    Already in the early age of 18 years I launched my own company, as I started developing web applications for local shops. I did all the work on my own (requirements, implementation, design, test) and focused on web based content management systems with PHP, MySQL and Flash. See chapter III. References & Open Source for some examples.

Junior IT consultant @ Oesterreichisches Juedisches Museum (2001-2003)
    I gained my first working experience as a museum employee with 16 years. It originally started as a holiday job but turned to a long-term employment pretty soon. The range of tasks was somehow spread, starting from the Euro change-over (MS Access), business statistics (MS Access/MS Excel), website (HTML/Flash), extending/wiring of the local network and many other minor things.

Federal Commercial Academy Eisenstadt (2000-2005)
    After secondary school I decided to join this specific ICT pilot project as it did not only teach economics, but also computer science where I therefore had the possibility acquiring my first professional skills with computers and programming.


                        III. REFERENCES & OPEN SOURCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attorneys - Website (2010)
    This project is currently in progress and was developed for a lawyer's office. A snapshot version can be found at [PrAt10]. The team working on it consisted of a project manager [CoHi07], a designer and me in the role as the developer. It has a highly sophisticating user interface implemented with Adobe Flex and its content is exchangable via a simple XML backend. All in all it took me 90 hours to finish this project.

Lisa Ruyter - Website (2009)
    Another project implemented with nearly the same technology (Flex, PHP and XML), the same team as for Attorneys and even the invested time is the same with about 80 hours. Lisa Ruyter is a world famous artist selling her paintings beginning with EUR 30,000 to EUR 75,000. The result can be found at [PrLi09].

Sound of Shopping - Art Project (2007)
    The aim of SoS is to transform barcodes into music which is unique to the products bought and where it is even possible reversing this operation (the date and up to five barcodes can be extracted). After a live presentation in an art super market the product was changed in such way that it is able to be used via a web interface [PrSo07]. A short article about this project can be found at [PrSa07] as well as the slides [SlSo07] of a minor presentation. All in all 8 people were involved; mainly musicians, a project manager and a math professor. Main technologies used were: Java, MIDI, QTJ, JFugue, Kontakt (sequencer), Mac OS X, PHP, MySQL and lots of (customized) hardware. All in all it took me 130 hours to implement every piece of code.


HSC - Website (2009)
    This little website [PrHs09] is an internet representation of my band HSC (aka Hoerspielcrew) and was realized with Adobe Flex. Our group exists since 2000, released 3 albums, played about more than 300 concerts, were !!! (was) !!! nominated for several awards, and it is said that we are one of the two most famous hip hop crews in whole !!! (verdeutscht..besser waere in Austria oder most famous huh crews throughout Austria ) !!! Austria. The style originated from hip hop, but influences from dancehall, reggae, pop-rock, grime and dubstep makes our music unique.

Cyberschool Competition - Webshop (2004)
    A webshop implemented for a local record store (kiki-hifi) with which I won the 2nd place in category technics at the cyberschool.at competition. It was implemented with PHP and MySQL, parts (audio preview, soundbox) were with realised Flash. It was entirely implemented by myself and took me about three weeks -no exact time protocol available, but it was a lot ;)

Vom Tullnerbach - Website (2004)
    A highly customizable website for a professional dog breeder [PrVo04]. Again the technologies used where PHP, MySQL and partly Flash, me as the only person working on it. Time effort was about five weeks.

Drum Energy - Website (2003)
    A fully Flash animated website interacting with MySQL via AMFPHP. This was a smaller project (only me) and the invested effort was about 30 hours. The site was meanwhile completely reworked.

Coldfish - Webplatform (2005)
    My school leaving examination project was a platform written within a total of 400 hours (single man project). It was a community driven platform providing Flash games, computer tutorials, scripts and tha-like. Many different technologies were used, among them: FreeBSD, Red Hat, PHP, MySQL, Flash, BlueDragon (Coldfusion FOSS alternative), phpAdsNew, AMFPHP, phpbb, AWStats, Photoshop, Fireworks, Flash Communication Server, Swift 3D, ... Slides of the presentation can be found at [SlCo05].
    

OurMovies (2008)
    This is yet another movie management tool (are you able to organize all your legally downloaded movies?!), but going far beyond that as it provides features like metadata fetching, video player and it even got file sharing capabilities to make our lives easier when it comes to exchanging movies among friends. Main technologies used: Java, Swing(X), QTJ (Quicktime for Java) and db4o (object oriented database). It consists of 342 classes and 23.346 lines of code. For a quick overview of the complete user interface see attachment [MiOm08] and some slides [SlOm08] are available online as well. This project is only maintained by myself and can be found on sourceforge [PrOm08].

PotPourri (2008-....)
    It all started with the library JPotPourri, as I was already working on several Java projects and wanted to create a reusable code base, which then I made public on sourceforge [PrJp08]. Getting inspired by the Flex framework, and especially the concept of value binding, the JPotFace project was born, an enhancement for (the living dead) Swing. Meanwhile I also created the same for Flex named FxPotPourri and even for the Android platform APotPourri (aka androidnstuff), which mainly provides an abstraction layer over the not-so-OOP API of Android. This project is only maintained by myself.

FlexMojos (2009-....)
    Being a heavy Maven user I was glad to find a (maybe not that) mature project for also supporting ActionScript/Flex based applications. For this I contributed lots of patches which were all accepted and at Bwin I am also maintaining a custom fork of FlexMojos.

Besides these two major projects I also did some minor contributions to the Eclipse PyDev plug-in in version 1.3.19 and other projects by submitting bug reports (e.g. AspectJ) or feature requests (e.g. Songbird).


                           IV. COMPUTER LANGUAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Actually I am more into statically typed and strict languages, as I am always trying to reduce the possibility of runtime errors and shift error detection at compile time. I also prefer object oriented languages with some some !!! (wortwiederholung?) !!! functional and aspect oriented influences. My coding style could be much !!! (was willst du sagen?) !!! described as very defensive therefore (prefer immutability, fail often fail early, dynamic dispatch instead of if-cascades, make use of enums, et cetera). Of course I understand the benefits of a dynamically typed language but for this it needs much discipline to fully live test driven development.
    Concerning the languages used at Google for me everything is the same, at least if it's not Basic. Especially Java can be seen as my big love, my primary language, the one and only, since 2003. One could say I feel quite confident with this language. Python is one of my preferred scripting language (besides of PHP), and I am using it from time to time as it is pretty easy and straight forward. Just recently I attended the university summer course "Communication Protocols" in Moldowa where we had to develop server-client applications with Python. Finally coming to C and C++ (as well Objective-C) I have written lots of things with them but to be honest I do not like these languages as they are way too close to the hardware. I prefer something at a higher abstraction layer where I am able to focus on "the real deal".
   Finally I would like to provide a list of languages I gained expierences with. This list could be understand as a kind of top-down order: Java, ActionScript, XML&Co, PHP, SQL, LaTeX, UML, JSF, JSP, Python, PL/SQL, bash, C, JavaScript, C++, AppleScript, Perl, Haskell, C#, Groovy, SmallTalk, Objective-C, Pascal, Ruby, VB(A), Eiffel, JavaFX, Prolog, Scala, ASP, CFML.
