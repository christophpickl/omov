<h1>Repository Scan</h1>

<p>
	This feature let you scan a given directory for movie folders. It simply uses the folder name as the title and fetches 
	metadata if you have selected the appropriate checkbox.<br>
	<br>
	SCREENSHOT of menubar entry<br>
	SCREENSHOT of dialog itself (with numbers on important places which then can be referenced in text)<br>
</p>

<h2>Different highlighted row background in table for scanned movies?!</h2>
<p>
	This means that the title fetched from the internet is different from the folder's name (only appears if additionally fetching metadata).<br>
	SCREENSHOT list of scanned movies, some of them with different row bg color
